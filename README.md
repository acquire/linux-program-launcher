#Functionality

It works by listing all the files in your /usr/bin directory. 

Then type away to search for your program. 

App launches selected program and exits when you press enter.

Alternatively, to exit simply hit ESC key.

#Setup

I'm running Xubuntu and using XFCE4 desktop environment. I have only tested using this.

Install mono runtime if you havent already. I did this using "sudo apt-get install mono".

Download the .exe and right click on icon and choose "Open with "Mono Runtime"". (Instead of "Open with mono Runtime (Terminal))

Move or copy it to /usr/bin.

Map left Windows key to this app! (In XFCE, run "xfce4-keyboard-settings", go to application shortcuts tab, click add button, type "linux-program-launcer.exe", press the desired key (i use left Windows key). 

And that's it! Try it out!
